<h1 id="doc">Using Tax-Calculator</h1>

<p>This document tells you how to use Tax-Calculator, an open-source
federal income and payroll tax simulation model.  The two ways of
using Tax-Calculator described here require no computer programming.
If you want to participate in the development of Tax-Calculator
&mdash; by reporting a bug, improving the documentation or making an
enhancement to the Python source code &mdash; you should go to
the <a href="https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator">
developer website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="gui">TaxBrain GUI</h2>

<p>You can use Tax-Calculator via a graphical user interface (GUI)
provided by the <a href="http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/">TaxBrain web
application</a>.  This approach requires only an Internet connection
and web browser on your computer.  TaxBrain (TB) uses a micro dataset
to produce both aggregate and distributional reform estimates for each
of ten years for a tax reform you specify.  The calculations take just
a couple of minutes and there is flexibility to show different kinds
of distributional results.</p>

<h3 id="gui-spec-reform">Specify Tax Reform</h3>

<p>The first step in using TaxBrain is to set the Start Year for the
tax calculations.  Then specify the values of policy parameters that
you want to change in your reform.</p>

<p>By default the policy parameter boxes contain Start Year values.
Simply replace the current-law value with the Start Year reform value.
If some or all of your reform provisions are going to begin after the
Start Year, simply fill in the pre-reform years with asterisks.  So,
for example, if Start Year is 2017 and your reform calls for raising
the social security payroll tax rate to 13 percent in 2018 and then
to 14 percent in 2020, you would enter in that box the following:
<pre>*,0.13,*,0.14</pre>
This parameter is not indexed, so the 0.13 value for 2018 will be
extrapolated to 2019, and the 0.14 value for 2020 will be in force
in all subsequent years.</p>

<p><a href="#gui">Back to Section Contents</a></p>


<h3 id="gui-init-static">Initiate Static Analysis</h3>

<p>Simply click on the Show me the results! button to start the tax
calculations.  That button will use the full sample and take a couple
of minutes to compute revenue and distributional results for each of
ten years beginning with the Start Year you specified.</p>

<p>There is also a Quick Calculation! button that produces results
only for the Start Year using a sub-sample of the full sample.</p>

<p><a href="#gui">Back to Section Contents</a></p>


<h3 id="gui-view-static">View/Download Static Results</h3>

<p>After the tax calculations are completed, you are shown a results
page that presents various options: you can specify, view and download
a total liabilities table, your can specify, view and download a
distribution table, you can use your reform to conduct different types
of dynamic analysis (via the button labeled Link to Dynamic
Simulations), and finally, you can go back to the policy parameters
page to modify your reform (via the button labeled Edit Parameters).</p>

<p>There are three variants of the <b>total liabilities table</b>.
The variant shown initially is Change, meaning the amounts are the
difference between liabilities under your reform and the liabilities
projected for current-law policy.  You can also elect to see the
reform and current-law levels.</p>

<p>There are many variants of the <b>distribution table</b>.  Try
clicking on the options to the left to define the nature of the table
and the year for which it is constructed.  Try clicking on the options
to the right to specify which columns are included in the table.  An
easy way to uncheck all the column boxes is to double click on the
Select All box.</p>

<p>There are four download options for each of these two tables:</p>

<p><b>Print</b> creates a new page in your browser that is suitable
for printing.</p>

<p><b>Copy</b> puts the table on the clipboard of your local computer
so that you can paste it anywhere on your computer.  The copy on the
clipboard uses invisible tab characters to separate the table's
columns.</p>

<p><b>CSV</b> downloads to your computer a CSV-formatted file
containing the information in the table.</p>

<p><b>Excel</b> downloads a file suitable for using with an Excel
spreadsheet.</p>

<p><a href="#gui">Back to Section Contents</a></p>


<h3 id="gui-init-dynamic">Initiate Dynamic Analysis</h3>

<p>After clicking on the Link to Dynamic Simulation on the static
results page, you are presented with a page that allows you to choose
three different types of dynamic simulations to conduct on your tax
reform:</p>

<p><b>Partial Equilibrium Simulation</b> is described this way:
<i>This approach answers the question, <q>how would taxpayer behavior
(income and deductions) affect revenue if all other prices in the
economy could stay the same?</q></i></p>

<p><b>Overlapping Generations Simulation</b> is described this way:
<i>This approach answers the question, <q>how does tax policy affect
macroeconomic aggregates and prices?</q></i></p>

<p><b>Macro Elasticities Simulation</b> is described this way:
<i>This approach harnesses econometric estimates of the historical
relationship between tax policy and the macroeconomy to predict the
effect of tax reforms on growth.</i></p>

Clicking on one of these choices will allow you to specify some
addition economic response parameters and initiate the dynamic
analysis using your response parameter assumptions.

<h2 id="cli">tc CLI</h2>

<p>You can use Tax-Calculator on your own computer via a command line
interface (CLI) called tc.  This approach requires the installation of
Anaconda Python and the taxcalc package on your computer as well as
the use of a text editor to prepare simple files that are read by tc.
Computer programming knowledge is not required, but if you are
prevented from doing the easy installation or you are not willing to
work at the command line (Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on
Windows) and use an editor (for example, TextEdit on Mac or Notepad on
Windows), then you should probably use the TaxBrain GUI.  However,
there are some advantages (as described below) so the extra
installation and file preparation work may be worth it to you.</p>

<h3 id="cli-install-test">Install/Test tc CLI</h3>

<p>Installation of tc CLI involves several steps:</p>

<p><b>Install the free Anaconda Python distribution</b> by going to
the <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Continuum Analytics
download page</a> and selecting a version of Python suitable for your
computer.  You should install Python 2.7, which is the older and more
stable version.  You must do this installation even if you already
have Python installed on your computer because the Anaconda
distribution contains all the additional Python packages that
Tax-Calculator uses to conduct tax calculations (many of which are not
included in other Python installations). You can install the Anaconda
distribution without having administrative privileges on your computer
and the Anaconda distribution will not interfere with any Python
installation that came as part of your computerâ€™s operating
system.</p>

<p><b>Check your Anaconda Python installation</b> by entering the
following two commands at the operating system command prompt (which
is shown as <kbd>$</kbd> here, but would be <kbd>></kbd> on Windows)
in any directory:
<pre>$ conda --version</pre>
Expected output is something like <kbd>conda 4.3.17</kbd>
<pre>$ python --version</pre>
Expected output should contain the <kbd>Python 2.7.</kbd> and
<kbd>Anaconda</kbd> phrases, the presence of which confirm that the
installation went smoothly.  The full output could look something
like this <kbd>Python 2.7.12 :: Anaconda 2.3.0 (x86_64)</kbd>.</p>

<p><b>Install the free taxcalc package</b> by entering the following:
<pre>$ conda install -c ospc taxcalc</pre>
Expected output should contain information about all the additional
packages that Tax-Calculator needs.  After all that information has
been shown on the screen, press the <kbd>y</kbd> key to proceed with
the package installations.</p>

<p><b>Check your installation of tc</b> (the CLI to Tax-Calculator) by
entering the following:
<pre>$ tc --test</pre>
Expected output (after about twenty seconds) is <kbd>PASSED
TEST</kbd>.  If you get <kbd>FAILED TEST</kbd>, something went wrong
in the installation process.  If the installation test fails, please
report your experience on
the <a href="http://list.ospc.org/mailman/listinfo/users_list.ospc.org">Tax-Calculator
users mailing list</a> or in an email to one of the core maintainers
of Tax-Calculator listed at the bottom of the <i>What is TaxBrain?</i>
page at <a href="http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/">this website</a>.

<p>If your installation passes the test, you are ready to begin using
tc to analyze your tax reforms.  Continue reading this section for
information about how to do that.  But if you want a quick hint about
the range of tc capabilities, enter the following:
<pre>$ tc --help</pre>
</p>

<p>The basic idea of tc tax analysis is that each tax reform is
specified in a text file using a simple method to describe the details
of the reform.  If your plan is to use tc to analyze tax reforms on
your local computer, it is best to read the remaining parts of this
section in order.  If your plan is to upload reform files to TaxBrain
and view results there (and/or download those results to your computer
for further analysis), you can read the next section on how of specify
a tax reform file and then skip to the last part of this section on
how to upload a reform file to TaxBrain.</p>

<p><a href="#cli">Back to Section Contents</a></p>


<h3 id="cli-spec-reform">Specify Tax Reform</h3>

<p>The details of a tax reform are contained in a text file that you
write with a text editor.  The reform is expressed by specifying which
tax policy parameters are changed from their current-law values by the
reform.  The timing and magnitude of these policy parameter changes
are written in JSON, a simple and widely-used data-specification
language.</p>

<p>For several examples of reform files and the general rules for
writing JSON reform files, go
to <a href="https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/reforms/REFORMS.md">this
page</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to upload reform files to TaxBrain for static analysis
(rather than use the tc CLI on your computer for analysis), go to this
section's last part, which discusses reform file uploading.  If you
want to assume any responses to your tax reform (that is, if you want
to conduct non-static analysis), read the next part before going to
the last part.</p>

<h2 id="params">Response Parameters</h2>

<p>This section contains documentation of several sets of parameters
that characterize responses to a tax reform.  Consumption
parameters are used to compute marginal tax rates.  Behavior
parameters are used to compute changes in input variables caused by a
tax reform in a partial-equilibrium setting.  Growdiff parameters are
used to specify baseline differences and/or reform responses in the
annual rate of growth in economic variables.</p>

<p>All the response parameters can be used by the tc CLI, but only
those with a <i>TB Name</i> appear in the TaxBrain GUI.  All these
dynamic response parameters control advanced features of
Tax-Calculator, so understanding the
<a href="https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/tree/master/taxcalc">source
code</a> that uses them is essential.  Each default parameter value is
zero and is projected into the future at that value, which implies no
response to the reform.  Using the default no-reform-response
assumption for all the response parameters generates a static analysis
of the tax reform.</p>
