Cross-Checking Tax-Calculator Reform Results from TaxBrain and taxcalc
======================================================================

The contents of this taxcalc/taxbrain directory are for use by the
core development team only and require software that is not described
elsewhere.  The purpose of the capabilities in this directory is to
test that Tax-Calculator produces essentially the same results when
accessed in two different ways: (1) via the TaxBrain webapp running
in the cloud and (2) via the taxcalc package running on this computer.
