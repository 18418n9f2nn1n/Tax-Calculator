Cross-Checking TaxBrain and Tax-Calculator Reform Results
=========================================================

The contents of this taxcalc/taxbrain directory are for use by the
core development team only and require software that is not described
elsewhere.  The purpose of the capabilities in this directory is to
test that the TaxBrain Internet site produces essentially the same
results as the Python Tax-Calculator on this local computer.
