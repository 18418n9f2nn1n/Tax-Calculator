This parameter specifies a (decimal, not percentage) factor that is added to those growth rates for the construction of the economic baseline.  For example if you supply 0.02, then 0.02 will be added to the wage and salary growth rate, interest income growth rate, dividend growth rate, schedule E income growth rate, and all other growth rates used to extrapolate the underlying dataset.",
