This directory contains examples of tax reform provisions that can be
combined and modified to construct tax reform proposals.

Such reform proposals can then be uploaded to the [TaxBrain
webapp](http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/) (or used on your local
computer) to estimate reform effects.

[This document](REFORMS.md) provides access to the reform provisions
in a way that corresponds to how the policy parameters are organized
on the TaxBrain webapp.
