# one loop iteration (do this for every year)
# for every row in database:
# we take our data and age it a year to array djfo ?
# using this data we calculate tax1 using calc procedure
# add $1 to income element of djfo
# we calculate tax2 using calc procedure and modified djfo
# if tax2 != tax1, set records to active
# we calculate tax3 using tax2 and modified djfo
# pick 3 random active records and set them to zero

# return table of tax0

# return table of tax3 - tax1

# go to next row
